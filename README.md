## Basics

### What you need in this hobby

**Why would I need all these tools**
- There are several reasons why you might need a variety of tools for a hobby. One reason is that higher quality tools can often produce better results and help you avoid damaging your equipment. Additionally, having the right tools can make the task at hand easier and more efficient. While it is true that investing in new tools can be intimidating, it is ultimately up to you to decide if the benefits of having the right tools outweigh the cost.

**Tools you might need**
- To properly disassemble a mouse, it is important to have a toolkit that includes screwdrivers and other necessary tools. While the iFixit Pro Tech toolkit ($70) is a good option, any set of screwdrivers, and additional tools should be sufficient. Keep in mind that having the right tools will make the disassembly process easier and more efficient.

![image30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113631536/213818821-f0f89d89-f64f-4220-9d8a-6061d176e56b.png)

- For a solder station, don’t cheap out on some soldering iron which doesn’t have any control, get something that you can change the temperature of. I would recommend the UY CHAN TS100 ($80) or the PINE64 Pinecil ($25) if you just need to do a bit of soldering. But if you want something better you can also get the HAKKO FX-888D ($105).

Image

- If you plan on removing switches or encoders, it is a good idea to invest in a desoldering pump or desoldering wick. The ENGINEER SS-02 ($30) is a good option for a desoldering pump, but for desoldering wick, it is important to purchase from a reputable company such as Chemtronics. Having these tools will make the process of removing switches or encoders easier and more efficient.

Image

- To make soldering tasks easier, it can be helpful to have a tool that holds your PCBs in place. A generic "3rd hand" or mini PCB holder can be useful for this purpose. These tools allow you to keep your PCBs stable while you work, which can improve the accuracy and precision of your soldering job.

Image

- It is a good idea to keep some extra mouse feet on hand in case you damage the old ones or want to upgrade from the stock options. Some popular aftermarket options include Corepadz, Hotline Games, Hyperglides, and Tiger Arc / Tiger ICE. If you do not have extra mouse feet, a temporary solution for damaged ones is to apply heat to them and place them on a flat surface with a heavy object on top to help them return to their original shape. To improve the stickiness of the mouse feet, you can also try heating clay and applying it to the bottom of the glides.

Image

- Nylon plastic spudgers are a useful tool for removing mouse skates because they are non-scratch and non-stick. This makes them gentle on the mouse and helps prevent damage to the skates. Additionally, because they are non-stick, they can make it easier to remove the skates without them getting stuck or stuck to the spudger.

Image

- In addition to the tools mentioned above, it is also important to consider the type of screwdriver you will need for your specific mouse. Razer mice often use 6-edge screws, also known as Torx screws, which require a 6mm 6-edged nozzle on the screwdriver to properly disassemble. Make sure to have the correct screwdriver on hand to avoid any issues when disassembling your mouse. If there are any other tools or information that you think might be useful, feel free to point them out.

### How to open up a mouse
- If you are unsure of how to open up your mouse, you can try searching online for specific instructions. If you cannot find any information, the following guide should work for most mice:
- To open up your mouse, you will need:
	- A screwdriver
	- New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)
- First, remove the mouse feet. You can use a hair dryer or alcohol to soften the adhesive, but be careful not to deform the plastic. Next, unscrew the screws located under the mouse feet. Some mice may have additional screws located under a sticker. Carefully open the mouse to avoid pulling on any ribbon cables or wires connected to the top shell. If there are any ribbon cables or wires connected to the top shell, disconnect them before removing the top shell. Once the top shell is off, you can modify the mouse as desired.

## Main Buttons

### Pre-travel

**What is pre-travel and why it happens**
- Pre-travel refers to the play between the mouse button plunger and the switch. To fix this issue, you can place something between the plunger and the switch to bring them closer together and eliminate the play. This will help the switch activate more smoothly and reliably.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you will need the following materials:
	- Aluminum or masking tape
	- Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape
	- New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)

**How to fix pre-travel**
- To fix the pre-travel of a mouse button:
	1. Open the mouse and locate the button that needs to have its pre-travel fixed on the top shell.
	2. Cut a piece of aluminum tape that is roughly the size of the button plunger and stick it to the part of the plunger that contacts the switch. It may be necessary to use 1-3 layers of tape to achieve the desired effect. Avoid using too many layers, as this can cause the switch to actuate too easily. If one layer is not enough but two layers are too many, you can try using thinner electrical tape instead.
	3. Close the mouse without screwing it back together and try activating the button to test if the pre-travel has been fixed. If there is still some pre-travel present, add another layer of tape and test again.
	4. Once the pre-travel has been eliminated, reassemble the mouse.
- Alternatively:
	1. Locate the limiters of the mouse buttons on the mouse skeleton. These are the parts that contact the pillars under the buttons when the switch is activated.
	2. Apply tape to the bottom side of the limiter or to the flat side of the pillar to reduce pre-travel and make the buttons slightly lower.
	3. Test the button to ensure that the pre-travel has been fixed.
	4. Reassemble the mouse.

### Post-travel

**Why post-travel happens**
- Post-travel refers to the phenomenon in which a mouse button continues to move slightly after it has been clicked and the switch has been activated. This can be caused by the button having some flexibility at its base, which allows it to move slightly even after the click has been registered.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you will need the following materials:
	- Aluminum or masking tape
	- Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape
	- New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)

**How to fix post-travel**
- To fix post-travel, follow these steps:
	1. Open up your mouse.
	2. Press down the main buttons on the top shell of the mouse and identify the point at which you can no longer press down.
	3. Place one or more layers of aluminum tape at this point on the plastic parts of the mouse (not on the board).
	4. Reassemble the mouse clicks and top shell on the bottom shell.
	5. Test the mouse to see if there is any more post-travel. If there is, repeat the process of adding aluminum tape until there is no more post-travel. Be careful not to add too much tape, as this can cause the button to feel strange when pressed.
	6. Once you are satisfied with the post-travel, reassemble the mouse. You are done!

### Side wobble

**What is side wobble and why fix it**
- Side wobble refers to the phenomenon in which the main buttons of a mouse move from side to side, giving a feeling of looseness or cheapness. This issue is often caused by poor tolerance in the mouse's construction, but it can be easily fixed by opening up the mouse. While some people may not be bothered by side wobble in their buttons (e.g. the user has an Aerox 3), others may prefer to fix it for a better overall feel. If you are comfortable with opening up your mouse, there is no good reason not to perform this modification.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you will need the following materials:
	- Aluminum or masking tape
	- Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape
	- New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)

**How to un-wobble your buttons**
- To fix side wobble in the main buttons of a mouse:
	1. Open the mouse and separate the top shell from the bottom shell.
	2. Locate the mouse button plungers (the part that presses down on the mouse switch) on the top shell. You should see a plastic piece in the middle of the plunger and possibly walls on each side.
	3. Remove the main buttons from the top shell. The process for doing this may vary depending on your specific mouse, so you may need to consult a guide or use screws or clips to remove the buttons carefully.
	4. Once the main buttons are removed, begin adding tape to the outer walls of the mouse button plunger, or to the plastic piece in the middle (if the outer walls are not present).
	5. Carefully apply the tape one layer at a time, making sure that the size is appropriate and that the tape is properly aligned. After each layer, reassemble the main buttons and test the mouse for side wobble. If the wobble persists, add another layer of tape.
	6. Avoid adding too much tape, as this can cause the button to feel stiff or difficult to press. If you need to put the tape inside the mouse button plunger, follow the same process but be extra careful to ensure that the tape is not too large and is properly aligned.
	7. Once you are satisfied with the lack of side wobble, reassemble the mouse. You are done!

### Main button switch replacement

**Why should you replace your switches**
- There are several reasons why someone might want to change the switches in their mouse, such as:
	- Experiencing double clicking issues
	- Having a broken switch
	- Simply wanting to try out different switches
	- The original switches being of poor quality
- In any of these cases, replacing the switches in the mouse can be a useful solution.

**What you need**
- To change the switches in your mouse, you will need the following items:
	- New mouse switches
	- New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones are damaged)
	- A soldering station
	- Solder
	- A desoldering pump wick (while it is technically possible to change the switches without these tools, it may result in a less clean job and increase the risk of damaging the board or components)

**Switch choices**
- Before choosing new switches for your mouse, consider the following:
	1. Check the type of switches currently being used in your mouse. If you have a Razer mouse, make sure it does not use optical switches, and if you have a SteelSeries mouse, ensure that it does not use optical magnetic switches. These types of switches cannot be changed with standard mechanical switches, although you can replace them with the same type of switch.
	2. Determine whether your mouse uses 3 pin or 2 pin switches.
	3. If your mouse uses Omron switches, note that Japanese Omrons have a longer dot than Chinese Omrons. This may be an issue if you are considering switching to a different type of Omron switch.
	4. Consider your personal preferences when selecting new switches. Some popular options include Kailh GM 8.0 or Huano Blue Shell White Dot, but ultimately it is a matter of personal preference. You can even use two different switches if desired.

	- [Mouse switch sound tests](https://youtube.com/watch?v=5bkEPBdiniE)

**Switching the switches**
- To change the switches in your mouse, follow these steps:
	1. Test the new switches to ensure they are functioning properly.
	2. Open the mouse and locate the board where the switches are located. This may be on the bottom board for most mice, or on a separate board for some models.
	3. Remove the board from the mouse housing and disconnect any wires or ribbon cables connected to it.
	4. Flip the board over and expose the pins of the switch.
	5. Secure the board in place using tape or another method to prevent it from sliding around, being careful not to cover the switch pins.
	6. Heat the switch pins one at a time and use a desoldering pump or wick to remove the solder from the holes. Repeat this process for all the switches you want to remove.
	7. To make it easier to insert the new switches, apply some solder to one of the three holes.
	8. Align the switch pins with the holes on the board and apply the soldering iron to the hole with solder. When the solder liquifies, slide the new switch into place and ensure that it is sitting flush with the board. At this point, you can test the new switch to make sure it is working properly.
	9. Once the switch is aligned and seated correctly, solder the remaining pins in place. Repeat this process for all the switches you want to change.
	10. Test the new switches to ensure they are functioning properly.

### Button lifting fix

**What are you even talking about**
- Button lifting refers to the phenomenon in which the main buttons of a mouse can be lifted up slightly. This is typically not an issue on most mice, as some degree of button lifting is expected due to the flexibility of the main clicks. However, excessive button lifting can make the clicks feel less solid and may be undesirable to some users.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you will need the following materials:
	- Aluminum or masking tape
	- Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape
	- New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)

**How to do the button lifting fix**
- To fix button lifting in a mouse, follow these steps:
	1. Open the mouse and remove the main buttons to access the plastic piece in the middle of the main button contact pad.
	2. On the bottom of the plastic piece, where the main button contacts the switch's plunger, add a piece of tape. Be sure that the tape is not too large, as it may cause the button to touch the inside of the frame on some mice.
	3. Reassemble the main buttons and test for button lifting. If the lifting persists, add more tape until the main buttons do not travel up anymore.
	4. Be careful not to add too much tape, as this can cause the main buttons to sit too low and feel or look strange.
	5. Once you are satisfied with the lack of button lifting, the modification is complete.

## Sensor

### Sensor tape mod to reduce LOD

**Why does high LOD (lift off distance) happen**
- One possible reason for a mouse having a high lift-off distance (LOD) is that the lens is receiving more light than necessary for proper tracking, which can result in a higher LOD. To lower the sensor's LOD, you may want to consider using tape to block off some of this excess light. It is worth noting that this is only one potential cause of high LOD, and other factors may also be at play. If you are unsure about the specifics of your mouse's LOD or how to address it, it may be helpful to consult a guide or seek the advice of an expert.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you will need the following materials:
	- Aluminum or masking tape (if possible, get black tape as it blocks more light; stay away from transparent tape)
	- Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape

**How to do the tape mod**
- To lower the lift-off distance (LOD) of your mouse, follow these steps:
	1. Turn the mouse over and locate the mouse sensor, which should have a small dot. Under the dot, there should be more uncovered mouse sensor.
	2. Cut a piece of tape large enough to cover the lower part of the lens.
	3. Place the tape on the bottom part of the sensor, being careful not to cover the small dot.
	4. The closer you position the tape to the dot, the lower the LOD will become. However, if you place the tape too high, the sensor may not track your movement correctly. Therefore, it is important to position the tape as high as possible while still allowing for proper tracking.

**Precautions**

*By [u/McDinggle](https://reddit.com/u/mcdinggle)*
- While the tape trick will help reduce LOD, it does come with its own drawbacks. By reducing the amount of light that reaches the sensor, you may also degrade the maximum tracking speed. Therefore it is important to understand the trade off of this trick. Experiment with how high you place the tape to find the right balance for you.
- François Morier, a senior engineer at Logitech for 15 years “[The tape] is masking part of the light that comes from the LED. You are shortening the time when you lift that this LED will see a spot that is crossing the surface. If you put the tape… [the LED will reach that spot] much faster and provide the lift early. Then you have the feeling that, ‘Yay, I improved the lift!’ But in fact you improved the lift but degraded the maximum speed very often. Because having only half of the matrix or part of the matrix that is correctly illuminated will prevent you from having good high speed tracking. It will not that much affect the low speed but it will clearly kill the high speed on some surfaces. It’s a trade-off. If the guys are happy with that, maybe they’re not a very high speed player and can bear with this. But really it’s a trade-off.” ([Source](https://pcgamer.com/gaming-mouse-myths-busted)).

## Mouse Skates / Feet

### Changing out mouse skates / feet

**Why change them**
- One does not often come across stock mice with good feet, and even if you are satisfied with the stock ones, upgrading is usually a good idea. By replacing the mouse feet, you can improve the smoothness of the mouse's movement and enhance its control.

**Choosing the feet**
- There are several options available when it comes to selecting mouse feet, and the most popular choice is 100% PTFE feet. Other options include glass and ceramic feet, which may offer a different feel and can be a good choice for some users. Corepad and Tiger Arc 1/2 are two well-known brands of PTFE feet, while cloth mouse feet are another option but they are only suitable for use with hard or glass surfaces. Ultimately, the best choice will depend on your personal preference and the type of mouse and surface you are using.

**What you need**
- In order to replace your mouse feet, you will need the following materials:
	- New mouse feet
	- Hair dryer (optional, can be used to make the old feet easier to remove or flatten reapplied ones)
	- Alcohol or lighter fluid (optional, can be used to loosen the old mouse feet with minimal damage)
	- Small brush (to disperse the alcohol, if using)
	- A tool for removing the old feet, such as a screwdriver, knife, or a plastic tool to avoid damaging the old feet

**How to change your feet**
*Edited by HunzHurte*
- First heat up the mouse feet while covering up the sensor with your finger or a small piece of tape so you don’t damage it. You can also not heat the feet up but removing them will be harder and they will definitely be damaged. To prevent this, you can brush a bit of alcohol / lighter fluid around the edge of the mouse foot, wait a few seconds and carefully start peeling, then brush more alcohol under the glide and repeat. After peeling the feet off, clean off any left off adhesive with some alcohol wipes or any other method (just don’t damage the mouse plastic). Then you can carefully put on your new feet. If you do not have spare glides and absolutely need to reapply the removed feet, this is easier the less you have damaged them during the removal. However the warping and folding that your glides do have can be removed or minimized by reheating the feet after putting them in place before heavily pushing the mouse down on a flat, non-stick surface like a parchment paper, lined desk, or a tile. Please note that this is not a recommended procedure and can increase your mouse's drag or noise levels. And that’s it for changing mouse feet, it’s one of the simplest mods for your mouse.

## Batteries

### How to change out a battery for your wireless mouse

**Why change it**
- There are several reasons you may want to change the battery in your mouse:
	-   To extend the mouse's battery life
	-   To reduce the weight of the mouse
	-   If the current battery is no longer holding a charge or functioning properly
- It is important to note that replacing the battery in a mouse can be a technical task and may void the manufacturer's warranty if not done properly. It is generally recommended to refer to the manufacturer's instructions or seek assistance from a professional if you are not comfortable with disassembling electronic devices.

**Choosing the battery**
- It is important to choose the right battery for your mouse to ensure it functions properly and does not get damaged. Here are some things to consider when selecting a replacement battery:
	- Make sure the new battery is the same type as the one already in the mouse (e.g. LiPo)
	- Check that the voltage of the new battery is the same as the old one
	- Ensure the battery connector is compatible with the mouse (e.g. two or three pin connector)
	- Determine if the mouse requires the use of the factory PCB (printed circuit board) with all three wires connected in order to work properly
	- If the mouse is not charging after replacing the battery, you may need to desolder the old battery from the factory PCB and solder the new battery to it in order to get it to work.
- It is also important to follow proper safety precautions when handling batteries, such as wearing gloves and avoiding short circuits. If you are not comfortable with these tasks, it may be best to seek the assistance of a professional.

**What to do if your mouse uses AA or AAA batteries**
- If you want to modify your mouse by using a different type of battery, there are a few options to consider. Lithium batteries are the lightest option available and can help to decrease the weight of the mouse. If your mouse uses AA batteries, you can purchase an adapter or use aluminum foil to create a makeshift adapter in order to use AAA batteries instead. This can further reduce the weight of the mouse.
- It is important to note that modifying your mouse in this way may void the manufacturer's warranty and could potentially damage the mouse if not done correctly. It is generally recommended to refer to the manufacturer's instructions or seek the assistance of a professional if you are not comfortable with disassembling electronic devices.
- You can also consider modifying your mouse to use a rechargeable battery and make it rechargeable. A good resource for learning how to do this is a tutorial video, such as the one created by Beardedbob on modding a Glorious Model O- mouse. However, it is important to note that modifying your mouse in this way may void the manufacturer's warranty and could potentially damage the mouse if not done correctly. It is generally recommended to refer to the manufacturer's instructions or seek the assistance of a professional if you are not comfortable with disassembling electronic devices. Additionally, proper safety precautions should be taken when working with electronics and batteries. ([Source](https://youtube.com/watch?v=lBgS1EG7wy8))
- You can not put a AA or AAA battery in a mouse that doesn’t use one and you can’t do the other way around either because the voltages are different, if you do this, you can potentially fry your mouse.

**If the connector is not the same**
- To modify a mouse to use a rechargeable battery, you will need the following materials:
	- Soldering station
	- Solder
	- Electrical tape or heat shrink (to protect the connections)
- It is important to note that modifying your mouse in this way may void the manufacturer's warranty and could potentially damage the mouse if not done correctly. It is generally recommended to refer to the manufacturer's instructions or seek the assistance of a professional if you are not comfortable with disassembling electronic devices. Additionally, proper safety precautions should be taken when working with electronics and batteries.
- If the connector on the replacement battery is not the same as the one on the old battery, it is still important to ensure that the new battery has the same number of wires. To do this, you can compare the old and new batteries and determine which wire corresponds to which function (e.g. red is positive, black is negative, white is signal).
- To prepare the new battery for installation, start by snipping off the old battery connector, making sure to leave enough wire to solder on the new connector. Be careful to only snip one wire at a time, and cover each wire with electrical tape after snipping it to prevent the wires from touching. Then, do the same with the new battery connector.
- Next, you can begin soldering the wires together, making sure to double-check that the wires are properly connected. After soldering two wires together, cover the solder joint with electrical tape or use heat shrink to protect the connection and prevent the solder joints from touching.
- Once all of the wires have been soldered in the correct positions, the battery should be ready to be installed in the mouse. However, it is important to note that modifying your mouse in this way may void the manufacturer's warranty and could potentially damage the mouse if not done correctly. It is generally recommended to refer to the manufacturer's instructions or seek the assistance of a professional if you are not comfortable with disassembling electronic devices. Additionally, proper safety precautions should be taken when working with electronics and batteries.

**How to change the battery**
- To change the battery in a mouse, you will need:
	- A new battery
	- New mouse feet
	- Double-sided tape
	- A plastic prying tool (such as a spudger)
1.  Disassemble your mouse to remove the old battery. Handle it with care as it may still be useful.
2.  Avoid using sharp or metal objects when removing the battery to prevent piercing it and causing smoke.
3.  Try different places to insert the new battery. Keep in mind not to put it on the PCB (printed circuit board) as it may cause problems.
4.  If you want to change the weight balance of your mouse, experiment with different battery placements.
5.  Once you have found a suitable spot for the new battery, use double-sided tape to secure it in place.
6.  Double-check that the wires are in the right place and reconnect them.
7.  You have now successfully changed the battery in your mouse.

## Cables / Paracords

### Changing mouse cables

**Why change my perfectly good cable**
- Upgrading your mouse cable can improve the mouse's movement by reducing drag and increasing flexibility. This can make the mouse feel less restricted and closer to a wireless experience. Additionally, using a mouse bungee can further improve the cable's movement.

**Choosing the cable**
- You may be considering upgrading your cables and wondering where to purchase them. The location of your residence will determine the best options for purchasing cables nearby to minimize shipping costs.
- It can be frustrating when you are in a remote or rural area and finding a place to purchase cables is difficult. Even in more populated areas, the selection may be limited and you may have to settle for overpriced options or wait for shipping. It is unfortunate that access to these types of products can be limited by location and it can make the process of upgrading or repairing your equipment more difficult.

**Repinning a cable**
- When replacing a cable for your mouse, it is important to ensure that the pinout of the new cable matches that of your old cable. This can be checked by referring to the pinout guide on the website of the mouse manufacturer or a third-party website such as [https://mouseclub.co/pages/pin-layout-guide](https://mouseclub.co/pages/pin-layout-guide). To replace the cable, you will need a thin tool such as a knife or screwdriver to carefully release the wires from the connector housing. On one side of the connector, there are small plastic clips that hold the wires in place. Gently use your tool to lift these clips and remove the wires. Repeat this process for all the wires in the connector. Then, match the wires of the new cable to the corresponding wires of the old cable and insert them into the connector.
- There is also a guide for this by [Ents](https://youtube.com/watch?v=STW3msLuZeE).

**What you need**
- Tools and materials needed to replace mouse feet:
	- Screwdriver
	- New mouse feet
	- Heat shrink tubing (if not included with the new feet)
	- Lighter or hairdryer (to remove the old feet)

**How to install the mouse cable**

*By [u/stelios53](https://reddit.com/u/stelios53)*
- Installing a new cable in your mouse is also a very easy modification to do. Removing the feet and undoing the screws is of course the first step followed by carefully prying the shell open. When you are able to see the main PCB you’ll have to find where the cable connects to it and then remove the JST connector (the cable might be beneath the PCB so you might have to take some more screws out). Next you’ll make the heat shrink-made stress relief. You’ll have to cut two pieces, one about 2 cm and a second one about 1cm. Pass them both over the JST connector and position them where the cable meets the shell (the smaller goes over the larger one).Keep them at the correct position and after taking the cable off the mouse, heat the heat shrink with the lighter moving it slowly across the heat shrink. At this point you can tilt the cable while heating to give an angle to your stress relief to not touch the mousepad as much. After you’ve made sure that the pinout on your new cable is matching the old one you can proceed to connect it. Last step before sealing it all up is testing if your mouse still works.

### How to convert an old or stock cable to a custom paracord cable
*By [u/stelios53](https://reddit.com/u/stelios53), [u/BerserkHealer](https://reddit.com/u/BerserkHealer)*
- To make a custom mouse cable, the following materials and tools are required:
	- 550 Type III paracord
	- An old mouse cable
	- Heat shrink tubing
	- An X-Acto knife
	- Tweezers
	- Lighter
- Though creating a paracord cable from scratch is the best choice, the parts may not be available directly or you do not want to spend any money to upgrade your cable. That’s fine because you can convert your old stiff cable to a perfectly flexible paracord cable. Starting off you’ll have to carefully cut the outer shell of the cable with an X-Acto knife from the JST connector side all along the USB connector. This is quite the task and you can easily cut yourself if you’re not careful so take your time. When you’ve cut all the way to the USB connector you should cut the plastic casing from the side with a clean line if you’re planning on reusing the stock casing (if you are not, then just work on removing it) If you would rather not cut the stock plug casing, you can keep about an inch of rubber insulation coming out from the plug to heat shrink the paracord sleeve to. Adding a touch of glue where the paracord covers the rubber is a great way to keep it from pulling back off. After that you are left with four wires encased on the shielding, the shielding part will need to be removed since it adds stiffness and is not required. You can remove it by twisting it around the four cables and you can just cut it along the way as it’s quite annoying and lastly cut it on the USB connector end.
- Next is the untangling of each wire and straightening them out. Using tweezers or the X-Acto knife you’ll have to remove them from the JST connector lifting the little plastic tabs and pulling the cables. After that, twist each cable from the others and straighten them out (at this point you could drop them in hot water to further straighten them but I found it sketchy and not really worth it). Grab the paracord you have cut to the correct length (leave a little more than you need to be sure) and pull the inside strings a little and tape the cables onto them. This will help you pull the cables through much faster than pushing them by yourself (make sure the tape part is thin enough to pull through the paracord).Pull the strings from the other side and melt the frayed ends of the paracord with a lighter so as to not further the fraying. Now for the USB connector you can either glue the original casing back over the paracord (you’ll have to enlarge the stress relief) or make your own from two different sizes of heat shrink, the ones I use are 9Φ and 7Φ. The rest of the installation is documented over this one and should be straight forward.

### Reusing stress relief from stock cable

**Why take this extra step**
- Reusing the stock stress relief from your old cable can improve the fit and feel of your new wire / paracord in your mouse shell, and also give it a more polished appearance. Keep in mind that this modification does involve cutting the old stock cable and therefore, it is recommended to only use an old cable that will not be used again.

**What you need**
- To replace the mouse feet and cable, the following materials and tools will be required:
	- New mouse feet (if the old ones are damaged during the process)
	- Hair dryer (to remove the old mouse feet without causing excessive damage)
	- New cable / paracord
	- Scissors or cutting tool to trim the old cable
	- Tape
	- Drill bits (if the stock cable is too small for the new one)
	- Pliers (optional)
	- Knife or sharp tool to repin the cable

**How to reuse the stress relief**
- To replace the mouse cable and reuse the stress relief, the following steps should be taken:
	1. Open your mouse and remove the old cable. Identify the plastic or rubber piece that keeps the cable in the shell (this is the stress relief).
	2. Cut the cable on one side of the stress relief, leaving the other side intact. Carefully remove the cable from the stress relief, using pliers if necessary.
	3. Take a picture of the wire connections at the connector end, as these will need to be reconnected correctly for the mouse to function properly. You can refer to the connector pinout guide on [https://mouseclub.co/pages/pin-layout-guide](https://mouseclub.co/pages/pin-layout-guide) for reference.
	4. Use a knife or sharp tool to lift the small plastic teeth and remove the wires one by one.
	5. Tape the wires together tightly so that they will fit through the stress relief. Try to thread the new cable through the stress relief. If it does not fit, use a drill bit to slightly enlarge the opening until the cable fits through.
	6. Remove the tape from the wires and reconnect them to the JST connector, ensuring they are in the same position as they were before.
	7. Slide the stress relief up to the correct height.
- Note: Some mice do not have a stress relief so this mod is not relevant for those mice.

## Encoder / Scroll Wheel

### About encoders
- Encoders come in various types and sizes. Some encoders are short and have a tactile feel, while others are tall and have a smooth feel. The choice of encoder largely depends on personal preference, with the exception of the height of the encoder, which is a crucial factor. It is important to ensure that when replacing an encoder, you get one of the same size as the original. To determine the size of your encoder, measure the distance from the base of the encoder (where the metal part sits on the PCB) to the middle of the encoder dot.
- There are different types of encoders available, each with their own characteristics. For example, smooth encoders such as the Kailh Red encoder, and tactile encoders like the Alps Japanese encoder. Tactile encoders provide a distinct feeling between steps, but may be heavier than smooth encoders. The choice of encoder ultimately comes down to personal preference and practicality.

### Lubing the mouse encoder / making it less tactile

**Why would you ever do such a thing**
- Lubing up a mouse encoder can have some positive effects, but it is not for everyone. The process will make the scroll wheel feel less tactile and more smooth, which may not be desirable for some people. If you prefer a more tactile scroll wheel, then this modification may not be suitable for you.

**What you need**
- To lube the mouse encoder, the following materials and tools will be required:
	- New mouse feet (if the old ones are damaged during the process)
	- Lubricant/grease specifically designed for mechanical parts and movement (as it lasts longer)
	- Brush to apply the lubricant/grease
	- Screwdriver (if attempting to adjust the small metal part)

**How to lube the encoder**
- Before lubing the mouse encoder, it is important to remove the mouse feet. To do this, use a hairdryer to heat the glue under them and use a plastic tool to gently pry them off. Be sure to protect the sensor by covering it with your finger or a piece of tape. Once the feet have been removed, locate the encoder on the PCB. It is important to determine whether the encoder is dustproof / sealed or open. If the top of the encoder is sealed, this modification cannot be done. If it is open, proceed to the next steps.
- There is a spinning part on the encoder that makes contact with a metal piece that is bent towards it. To lubricate the encoder, use a small brush to add a small amount of lubricant to the spinning part of the encoder. Do not use too much lubricant as it can damage the encoder. Another option is to use a small screwdriver to gently bend the metal piece away from the spinning part, which will result in less tactility. However, be careful with this step as it can be difficult to achieve the desired level of tactility and going too far can damage the encoder.
- Please note that changing the encoder is a difficult process and it is recommended to seek professional help before attempting it.

### Decreasing scroll wheel click travel

**Why make the clicks have less travel**
- This modification may be considered if the middle click on your mouse has too much pre-travel. It aims to decrease the gap between the scroll wheel and the switch, making the middle click feel more solid and less loose.

**What you need**
- To decrease the pre-travel on a middle click, the following materials and tools will be required:
	- Heat shrink tubing or tubing (ensure that it is close to the original size or slightly larger)
	- New mouse feet (if the old ones are not reusable)
	- A cutting tool for the heat shrink/tubing

**Things to know before doing the mod**
- It is worth noting that some mice use a different type of switch for the scroll wheel and may require a different approach for this modification. For example, the Logitech G502 uses a low profile surface-mounted switch in place of a standard micro switch beside the scroll wheel. These switches can fail and result in the loss of the middle mouse click. If you are unsure of the type of switch your mouse uses, it's best to consult the manufacturer's website or seek professional help.

**How to do it**
- To decrease the pre-travel on a middle click, the following steps should be taken:
	1. Disassemble your mouse and remove the scroll wheel.
	2. Identify the two sides of the scroll wheel: the one inside the encoder and the one that touches the switch.
	3. Place the heat shrink tubing or tubing over the part that touches the switch.
	4. If using heat shrink tubing, apply heat to shrink it and hold it in place. Cut off any excess tubing.
	5. If using regular tubing, push it over the part that touches the switch and cut off any excess tubing. Ensure that the tubing is the right size.
	6. Add more tubing or heat shrink as needed, to reduce the pre-travel as much as possible.
- Please note that the exact steps may vary depending on the specific scroll wheel switch of your mouse.

## Shell / Body

### How to do a weight reduction

**Why chop my mouse up**
- The primary purpose of reducing the weight of a mouse is to increase its speed and maneuverability. Additionally, some individuals may choose to do so if the mouse feels too heavy and causes discomfort or fatigue.

**You should know before doing this**
- It is important to note that modifying the weight of a mouse can be risky. Incorrect adjustments may result in a less stable or poorly assembled mouse. In extreme cases, the shell may not fit properly.

**What you need**
- To reduce the weight of a mouse, you will need the following materials:
	- New mouse feet (if the current ones are damaged)
	- Flush cutters or pliers
	- Drill or Dremel tool (optional but can make the project easier)
	- Sandpaper or small file to smooth out rough edges

**How to remove the weight**
- Now that you are aware of the risks and necessary materials, you can begin the process of reducing the weight of your mouse. Start by disassembling the mouse completely and being cautious not to damage any electronics. Once you have all the individual parts of the mouse, set the electronics aside in a safe place where you can easily access them and ensure that you don't accidentally remove any important components.
- When performing a weight reduction, it is important to follow these guidelines:
	- Do not remove the supports for the electronics that will be reassembled.
	- Carefully consider which parts are essential and which can be removed.
	- When cutting around important parts of the shell, such as screw mounting points or the ring around the sensor, leave some plastic connected to them for support from the entire shell.

Image

- *Make a hole in the center of the mouse support, ensuring that it provides minimal support while still leaving enough plastic to hold the screw securely in place.*
- It's better to be safe than sorry, therefore it's advisable to remove less material rather than risk breaking the mouse by taking too much.
- If available, use a guide tailored to your specific mouse model.
- If desired, consider removing some parts of the mouse completely.

- *Removed the diffuser from the mouse as I am comfortable with less diffused lighting.*
- When modifying your mouse, it's important to keep in mind that each mouse is unique and each person has their own preferences for how much weight they want to remove. Consider removing buttons, switches, or even parts of the shell. You can also cut out some supports on the shell, just be sure they are not essential for the mouse's functioning.

Image

- *Removing some supports from the shell.*
- Sometimes, if there is an extra piece that goes over the main shell, you can cut out more plastic from the main body while still keeping the mouse looking polished. If you are not concerned about keeping the mouse looking stock, you can drill holes in the shell, but be cautious not to make too many and be mindful of their placement. To make the edges of your cuts look more polished and prevent accidental cuts, use sandpaper or a file to smooth out the edges. Keep in mind that every mouse is different, so this guide may not be as detailed as others. This is a general guide on how to remove weight from your mouse.

**Weight reduction using a drill**

*By [u/CalligrapherSlight81](https://reddit.com/u/calligrapherslight81)*
- Few words about drilling: To start weight reduction process, you need a drill (smaller - better, more handy) and 1.5 - 4 mm bits (at your preference, smaller holes means less weight reduction, but it’s better for ergonomics). Start drilling holes in most safe places (example: mouse bottom, inner skeleton, spots that have no contact with your hand).
- Bottom takes almost all of the side pressure, you should be careful with large holes in it, also do not chop stiffening ribs (see photo 2, 3).
- Also you can drill some blind holes from the inside of any part of the mouse (photo 4, 5). It will give an extra 20 - 40% of weight reduction from these spots. But be careful and keep all construction strong enough.
- If you want more - just keep in mind that drilling any construction will make it less strong. If you decide to drill holes in remaining spots, use a 60 degrees staggered type pattern. It will secure stability in these spots after perforation (photo1). Use 2 - 3 mm or smaller bits for mouse sides because smaller holes are less noticeable in use. But, as I said, you need to find a compromise between more weight reduction per hole / better ergonomics choosing hole diameter. Drill at low speeds.
- After drilling, use small round files / round mill bits, then sandpaper (500 - 1000 grid) to make it look and feel smooth. Pay attention to every single hole.
- Good luck in weight reduction, you can find a lot of interesting projects on my [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/CalligrapherSlight81)!

### How to install grip tape

**Why tape up your mouse**
- Applying grip tape to your mouse is a simple way to improve grip and customize the shape of the mouse to your preference. It's a good way to make the mouse more comfortable to use.

**What you need**
- To customize your mouse with grip tape, you will need the following items:
	- Grip tape with adhesive on the bottom side
	- Tape (such as painters tape) to hold the grip tape in place
	- Scissors to cut the tape and grip tape to the desired shape
- Be sure to follow the instructions of the grip tape and be careful when cutting it to your desired shape. This will help you to achieve the best results and get the most comfortable mouse for your hand.

**How to do it**
- To customize your mouse with grip tape, the first step is to determine the areas where you want to add grip. This can include the main buttons, sides of the mouse, side buttons, or any other part of the mouse you choose. For best results, use tape to mark the shape and size of the grip tape on the mouse. Once you have a clear idea of the shape, carefully cut out the grip tape to match your sketch. Then, apply the grip tape to the desired areas of the mouse and adjust as needed by cutting it to the perfect shape and size. Keep in mind that it may take a couple of tries to get the grips to fit the way you want them to.
