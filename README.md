## Basics

### What you'll need in this hobby

**Why would I need all these tools**
- There are several reasons why you might need a variety of tools for a hobby. One reason is that higher quality tools can often produce better results and help you avoid damaging your equipment. Additionally, having the right tools can make the task at hand easier and more efficient. While it's true that investing in new tools can be intimidating, it's ultimately up to you to decide if the benefits of having the right tools outweigh the cost.

**Tools you might need**
- To properly disassemble a mouse, it's important to have a toolkit that includes screwdrivers and other necessary tools. While the iFixit Pro Tech toolkit ($70) is a good option, any set of screwdrivers, and additional tools should be sufficient. Keep in mind that having the right tools will make the disassembly process easier and more efficient.

- For a solder station, don’t cheap out on some soldering iron which doesn’t have any control, get something that you can change the temperature of. I would recommend the UY CHAN TS100 ($80) or the PINE64 Pinecil ($25) if you just need to do a bit of soldering. But if you want something better you can also get the HAKKO FX-888D ($105).

Image

- If you plan on removing switches or encoders, it's a good idea to invest in a desoldering pump or desoldering wick. The ENGINEER SS-02 ($30) is a good option for a desoldering pump, but for desoldering wick, it's important to purchase from a reputable company such as Chemtronics. Having these tools will make the process of removing switches or encoders easier and more efficient.

Image

- To make soldering tasks easier, it can be helpful to have a tool that holds your PCBs in place. A generic "3rd hand" or mini PCB holder can be useful for this purpose. These tools allow you to keep your PCBs stable while you work, which can improve the accuracy and precision of your soldering job.

Image

- It's a good idea to keep some extra mouse feet on hand in case you damage the old ones or want to upgrade from the stock options. Some popular aftermarket options include Corepadz, Hotline Games, Hyperglides, and Tiger Arc / Tiger ICE. If you don't have extra mouse feet, a temporary solution for damaged ones is to apply heat to them and place them on a flat surface with a heavy object on top to help them return to their original shape. To improve the stickiness of the mouse feet, you can also try heating clay and applying it to the bottom of the glides.

Image

- Nylon plastic spudgers are a useful tool for removing mouse skates because they are non-scratch and non-stick. This makes them gentle on the mouse and helps prevent damage to the skates. Additionally, because they are non-stick, they can make it easier to remove the skates without them getting stuck or stuck to the spudger.

Image

- In addition to the tools mentioned above, it's also important to consider the type of screwdriver you'll need for your specific mouse. Razer mice often use 6-edge screws, also known as Torx screws, which require a 6mm 6-edged nozzle on the screwdriver to properly disassemble. Make sure to have the correct screwdriver on hand to avoid any issues when disassembling your mouse. If there are any other tools or information that you think might be useful, feel free to point them out.

### How to open up a mouse
- "If you're unsure of how to open up your mouse, you can try searching online for specific instructions. If you can't find any information, the following guide should work for most mice:
- To open up your mouse, you'll need:
	- A screwdriver
	- New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)
- First, remove the mouse feet. You can use a hair dryer or alcohol to soften the adhesive, but be careful not to deform the plastic. Next, unscrew the screws located under the mouse feet. Some mice may have additional screws located under a sticker. Carefully open the mouse to avoid pulling on any ribbon cables or wires connected to the top shell. If there are any ribbon cables or wires connected to the top shell, disconnect them before removing the top shell. Once the top shell is off, you can modify the mouse as desired."

## Main Buttons

### Pre-travel

**What is pre-travel and why it happens**
- Pre-travel refers to the play between the mouse button plunger and the switch. To fix this issue, you can place something between the plunger and the switch to bring them closer together and eliminate the play. This will help the switch activate more smoothly and reliably.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you'll need the following materials:
	-   Aluminum or masking tape
	-   Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape
	-   New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)

**How to fix pre-travel**
- To fix the pre-travel of a mouse button:
	1.  Open the mouse and locate the button that needs to have its pre-travel fixed on the top shell.
	2.  Cut a piece of aluminum tape that is roughly the size of the button plunger and stick it to the part of the plunger that contacts the switch. It may be necessary to use 1-3 layers of tape to achieve the desired effect. Avoid using too many layers, as this can cause the switch to actuate too easily. If one layer is not enough but two layers are too many, you can try using thinner electrical tape instead.
	3.  Close the mouse without screwing it back together and try activating the button to test if the pre-travel has been fixed. If there is still some pre-travel present, add another layer of tape and test again.
	4.  Once the pre-travel has been eliminated, reassemble the mouse.
- Alternatively:
	1.  Locate the limiters of the mouse buttons on the mouse skeleton. These are the parts that contact the pillars under the buttons when the switch is activated.
	2.  Apply tape to the bottom side of the limiter or to the flat side of the pillar to reduce pre-travel and make the buttons slightly lower.
	3.  Test the button to ensure that the pre-travel has been fixed.
	4.  Reassemble the mouse.

### Post-travel

**Why post-travel happens**
- Post-travel refers to the phenomenon in which a mouse button continues to move slightly after it has been clicked and the switch has been activated. This can be caused by the button having some flexibility at its base, which allows it to move slightly even after the click has been registered.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you'll need the following materials:
	-   Aluminum or masking tape
	-   Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape
	-   New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)

**How to fix post-travel**
- To fix post-travel, follow these steps:
	1.  Open up your mouse.
	2.  Press down the main buttons on the top shell of the mouse and identify the point at which you can no longer press down.
	3.  Place one or more layers of aluminum tape at this point on the plastic parts of the mouse (not on the board).
	4.  Reassemble the mouse clicks and top shell on the bottom shell.
	5.  Test the mouse to see if there is any more post-travel. If there is, repeat the process of adding aluminum tape until there is no more post-travel. Be careful not to add too much tape, as this can cause the button to feel strange when pressed.
	6.  Once you are satisfied with the post-travel, reassemble the mouse. You're done!

### Side wobble

**What is side wobble and why fix it**
- Side wobble refers to the phenomenon in which the main buttons of a mouse move from side to side, giving a feeling of looseness or cheapness. This issue is often caused by poor tolerance in the mouse's construction, but it can be easily fixed by opening up the mouse. While some people may not be bothered by side wobble in their buttons (e.g. the user has an Aerox 3), others may prefer to fix it for a better overall feel. If you are comfortable with opening up your mouse, there is no good reason not to perform this modification.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you'll need the following materials:
	-   Aluminum or masking tape
	-   Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape
	-   New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)

**How to un-wobble your buttons**
- To fix side wobble in the main buttons of a mouse:
	1.  Open the mouse and separate the top shell from the bottom shell.
	2.  Locate the mouse button plungers (the part that presses down on the mouse switch) on the top shell. You should see a plastic piece in the middle of the plunger and possibly walls on each side.
	3.  Remove the main buttons from the top shell. The process for doing this may vary depending on your specific mouse, so you may need to consult a guide or use screws or clips to remove the buttons carefully.
	4.  Once the main buttons are removed, begin adding tape to the outer walls of the mouse button plunger, or to the plastic piece in the middle (if the outer walls are not present).
	5.  Carefully apply the tape one layer at a time, making sure that the size is appropriate and that the tape is properly aligned. After each layer, reassemble the main buttons and test the mouse for side wobble. If the wobble persists, add another layer of tape.
	6.  Avoid adding too much tape, as this can cause the button to feel stiff or difficult to press. If you need to put the tape inside the mouse button plunger, follow the same process but be extra careful to ensure that the tape is not too large and is properly aligned.
	7.  Once you are satisfied with the lack of side wobble, reassemble the mouse. You're done!

### Main button switch replacement

**Why should you replace your switches**
- There are several reasons why someone might want to change the switches in their mouse, such as:
	-   Experiencing double clicking issues
	-   Having a broken switch
	-   Simply wanting to try out different switches
	-   The original switches being of poor quality
- In any of these cases, replacing the switches in the mouse can be a useful solution.

**What you need**
- To change the switches in your mouse, you will need the following items:
	-   New mouse switches
	-   New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones are damaged)
	-   A soldering station
	-   Solder
	-   A desoldering pump wick (while it is technically possible to change the switches without these tools, it may result in a less clean job and increase the risk of damaging the board or components)

**Switch choices**
- Before choosing new switches for your mouse, consider the following:
	1.  Check the type of switches currently being used in your mouse. If you have a Razer mouse, make sure it does not use optical switches, and if you have a SteelSeries mouse, ensure that it does not use optical magnetic switches. These types of switches cannot be changed with standard mechanical switches, although you can replace them with the same type of switch.
	2.  Determine whether your mouse uses 3 pin or 2 pin switches.
	3.  If your mouse uses Omron switches, note that Japanese Omrons have a longer dot than Chinese Omrons. This may be an issue if you are considering switching to a different type of Omron switch.
	4.  Consider your personal preferences when selecting new switches. Some popular options include Kailh GM 8.0 or Huano Blue Shell White Dot, but ultimately it is a matter of personal preference. You can even use two different switches if desired.

**Switching the switches**
- To change the switches in your mouse, follow these steps:
	1.  Test the new switches to ensure they are functioning properly.
	2.  Open the mouse and locate the board where the switches are located. This may be on the bottom board for most mice, or on a separate board for some models.
	3.  Remove the board from the mouse housing and disconnect any wires or ribbon cables connected to it.
	4.  Flip the board over and expose the pins of the switch.
	5.  Secure the board in place using tape or another method to prevent it from sliding around, being careful not to cover the switch pins.
	6.  Heat the switch pins one at a time and use a desoldering pump or wick to remove the solder from the holes. Repeat this process for all the switches you want to remove.
	7.  To make it easier to insert the new switches, apply some solder to one of the three holes.
	8.  Align the switch pins with the holes on the board and apply the soldering iron to the hole with solder. When the solder liquifies, slide the new switch into place and ensure that it is sitting flush with the board. At this point, you can test the new switch to make sure it is working properly.
	9.  Once the switch is aligned and seated correctly, solder the remaining pins in place. Repeat this process for all the switches you want to change.
	10.  Test the new switches to ensure they are functioning properly.

### Button lifting fix

**What are you even talking about**
- Button lifting refers to the phenomenon in which the main buttons of a mouse can be lifted up slightly. This is typically not an issue on most mice, as some degree of button lifting is expected due to the flexibility of the main clicks. However, excessive button lifting can make the clicks feel less solid and may be undesirable to some users.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you'll need the following materials:
	-   Aluminum or masking tape
	-   Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape
	-   New mouse feet (optional, in case the old ones get damaged or you want to replace them)

**How to do the button lifting fix**
- To fix button lifting in a mouse, follow these steps:
	1.  Open the mouse and remove the main buttons to access the plastic piece in the middle of the main button contact pad.
	2.  On the bottom of the plastic piece, where the main button contacts the switch's plunger, add a piece of tape. Be sure that the tape is not too large, as it may cause the button to touch the inside of the frame on some mice.
	3.  Reassemble the main buttons and test for button lifting. If the lifting persists, add more tape until the main buttons do not travel up anymore.
	4.  Be careful not to add too much tape, as this can cause the main buttons to sit too low and feel or look strange.
	5.  Once you are satisfied with the lack of button lifting, the modification is complete.

## Sensor

### Sensor tape mod to reduce LOD

**Why does high LOD (lift off distance) happen?**
- One possible reason for a mouse having a high lift-off distance (LOD) is that the lens is receiving more light than necessary for proper tracking, which can result in a higher LOD. To lower the sensor's LOD, you may want to consider using tape to block off some of this excess light. It is worth noting that this is only one potential cause of high LOD, and other factors may also be at play. If you are unsure about the specifics of your mouse's LOD or how to address it, it may be helpful to consult a guide or seek the advice of an expert.

**What you need**
- To complete this task, you'll need the following materials:
	-   Aluminum or masking tape (if possible, get black tape as it blocks more light; stay away from transparent tape)
	-   Scissors or a tool for cutting the tape

**How to do the tape mod**
- To lower the lift-off distance (LOD) of your mouse, follow these steps:
	1.  Turn the mouse over and locate the mouse sensor, which should have a small dot. Under the dot, there should be more uncovered mouse sensor.
	2.  Cut a piece of tape large enough to cover the lower part of the lens.
	3.  Place the tape on the bottom part of the sensor, being careful not to cover the small dot.
	4.  The closer you position the tape to the dot, the lower the LOD will become. However, if you place the tape too high, the sensor may not track your movement correctly. Therefore, it is important to position the tape as high as possible while still allowing for proper tracking.
